        Planet-hackNY was born one day when Eitan Adler (hackNY '11) thought it would be a good idea to create a <a href="http://www.planetplanet.org/">Planet</a> to showcase the blogs of <a href="http://www.hackny.org">hackNY</a> fellows.
    </p>

    <p>
        We soon discovered that the Planet software was almost seven years out-of-date, running a version of Python that was twelve years old, and using a database supported by neither Heroku nor any current version of Python.
    </p>

    <p>
        Being hackers, we took this as an opportunity to write our own software to power the site - which we did, naming it <a href="https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/pluto">Pluto</a>. Pluto is written in pure Go, using MongoDB as a backend to store the blog posts.
    </p>

    <p>
        Planet-hackNY is a joint effort spanning three years of hackNY: <a href="http://www.adityamukerjee.net">Aditya Mukerjee</a> (hackNY '11), <a href="http://rubinovitz.com/">Jennifer Rubinovitz</a> (hackNY '12), and <a href="http://www.processthings.com/">Dan Mundy</a> (hackNY '13).
